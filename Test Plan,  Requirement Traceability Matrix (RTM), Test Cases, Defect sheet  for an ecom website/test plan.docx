1. Introduction

This document outlines the test plan for the development of a comprehensive and user-friendly e-commerce website. The plan aims to ensure all functionalities meet specifications, provide a seamless user experience, and contribute to a successful launch.

2. Objectives

o	Verify compliance with functional and non-functional requirements.
o	Identify and resolve defects before user exposure.
o	Evaluate user experience and website usability.
o	Ensure security and performance meet acceptable standards.
o	Build confidence in the website's functionality and stability for launch.

3. Scope

This test plan covers all essential areas of the e-commerce website, including:
User Management: Registration, login, logout, password recovery, account management.
Product Catalog: Browsing, searching, filtering, product details, images, and specifications.

Order Management: Order tracking, history, returns and refunds.
Customer Support: Contact forms, feedback system, knowledge base.
Website Performance: Loading speed, responsiveness across devices, scalability.
Website Security:Data encryption, user authentication, vulnerability testing.




4. Testing Approach

A combination of testing approaches will be utilized:

o	Functional Testing: Verify features and functionalities against requirements.
o	Non-Functional Testing: Evaluate usability, performance, accessibility, and security.
o	Compatibility Testing: Ensure website functions across browsers and devices.
o	Regression Testing: Re-test previously fixed defects after new updates.
o	Exploratory Testing: Ad-hoc testing to discover potential issues not covered by planned cases.

5. Test Environment

o	Hardware and software configuration replicating the production environment.
o	Simulated data sets for testing various scenarios.
o	Access to all development and testing tools.

6. Test Schedule and Resources

o	Timelines for each testing phase and defect resolution.
o	Allocation of resources (testers, developers, QA leads) for testing execution.
o	Tracking and reporting tools for documenting progress and results.

7. Test Cases
Detailed test cases will be developed for each functionality, covering positive and negative scenarios. These cases will be linked to specific requirements and documented in a test management tool.(we have used excel).

8. Defect Management
o	A clearly defined process for logging, prioritizing, and resolving defects.
o	Effective communication between testers and developers during defect resolution.
o	Regular reporting on identified and resolved defects.

9. Test Reporting
o	Comprehensive reports summarizing test results, findings, and recommendations.
o	Clear documentation of defects and resolution status.
o	Reports distributed to stakeholders for informed decision-making.
